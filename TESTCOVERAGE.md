Our end-to-end testing is in todo-list.e2e-spec.ts
We check that the page has the correct title because it's important that the page has a title,
and the title displayed is the correct one.
We check that the filter input areas can be typed into, and that a specific, relevant todo
is displayed when a given filter is applied. This proves that a todo we expect to find isn't
missing.
